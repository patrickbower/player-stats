# Player stats brief

A single component brief requiring a development environment setup demonstrate front end development of a statistics card for players.

This is a simple development workflow as I 'strive to simplify' where possible. The gist of the workflow contains:

- Gulp and NPM task running
- SASS minified and concatenated single CSS with sourcemaps.
- ES6 JavaScript module pattern transpiled,  concatenated and minified to a single file with sourcemaps.
- Local development server startup with livereload.
- CLI `gulp` tasks setup to `watch`, `build` and `serve`.

Beyond the scope of a single component are additional workflow features such as:

- Automation for:
  - Linting
  - Documentation
  - Commit message formatting
  - Auto-prefixing
  - Image compression
- Modular components
- Strong CSS architecture such as ITCSS
